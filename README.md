Is It Friday?
=========================

Little GitHub app that checks whether it's Friday or not when you create a Pull Request, and reminds you if you shouldn't merge to master on Friday unless you are ready to work over the weekend.

Built with [Probot](https://probot.github.io) on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/about).
